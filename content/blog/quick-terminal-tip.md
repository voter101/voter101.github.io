There is one small thing that made my life as a software developer a little better. And not many people seem to know about it.

The trick is hotkey terminal window. It is basically an additional terminal window that is always visible, and you can show/hide it using a keyboard shortcut.

This additional window seemed to be really handy as a code scratchpad or dedicated man window. It is so convenient that I sometimes use it as the main terminal.

I believe this feature should be available on most platforms. I personally use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (Mac only) and it has this functionality built-in. In my case, the new window show/hide up after I press CTRL two times.
